# CIFAR-10-Prediction-ANN-:rocket:
This repository is about training and testing ANN architecture for CIFAR-10 Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.
In this project, the CIFAR-10 dataset was divided into 50,000 labeled training images and 10,000 unlabeled testing images. We further divided the training set into 
49,000 training samples and 1,000 validation samples to select the best model and hyper parameters. The classifier trained on the49,000 samples with the optimized 
parameters was then used to predict on the testing set and evaluate the prediction accuracy.
Nonlinear neural networks have a much better performance, with fully-connectedANN having accuracy higher than 50%
